Description: WebSocket & WAMP for Python on Twisted and asyncio. (Python 2)
 Autobahn|Python is a subproject of Autobahn and provides open-source
 implementations of:
 .
   - The WebSocket Protocol
   - The Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)
 .
 running on Twisted and asyncio.
 .
 You can use Autobahn|Python to create clients and servers in Python speaking
 just plain WebSocket or WAMP.
 .
 WebSocket allows bidirectional real-time messaging on the Web and beyond,
 while WAMP adds real-time application communication on top of WebSocket.
 .
 WAMP provides asynchronous Remote Procedure Calls and Publish & Subscribe for
 applications in one protocol running over WebSocket. WAMP is a routed
 protocol, so you need a WAMP Router to connect your Autobahn|Python based
 clients. We provide Crossbar.io, but there are other options as well.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
